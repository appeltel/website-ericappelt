# Introduction

This informal essay serves as a personal reflection and attempt to understand
Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. In beginning to read the book, I thought it
would be helpful to try to puzzle through the dialectic of each shape of
consciousness with my own examples, to better order my reflections on each
section of the work, and to improve my understanding.

In reading the initial sections of the Phenomenology, Hegel uses various
everyday objects to serve as examples, such as a tree in front of the observer,
or a small chunk of salt crystal that one might touch and taste. Initially
I thought I might try to find my own everyday example, such as a block of metal
or some knick-knack inhabiting my desk. However, I find two potential problems
with such an example. First, the object would be trivially similar to Hegel's
own example and the examples of the commentaries I have to aid in my reading.
Second, these objects have little meaning to my own personal consiousness in
making a claim to knowledge. As a particle, or more correctly a heavy-ion, 
physicist, my picture of the world is influenced more by the reconstructions
of fundamental particles that traverse a detector. These particles, or quantum
objects,  are in some deeper sense more "real" to me in that I am
professionally and personally invested in their fundamental nature. In at least
a practial manner, I hold these quantum objects to be the real constituents
of all matter and the basis of experienced reality.

A focus on a quantum object, say a high-momentum muon produced in a collision
between protons, is different and notable from a classical object such as a
chunk of salt in many respects. On the outset of this personal journey through
the Phenomenology, I hypothesize that most of these differences are not of
any metaphysical signficance. While my perception of the muon is mediated
by a complex process of reconstructing a trajectory through various detector
signals, and while the mathematical laws of quantum field theory that govern
it's motion are very different than those of a macroscopic chunk of salt, it
is still apprehended to my consious being as the object of my perception, and
just as a chunk of salt it has various properties that may be "sensed" in
different ways by different detector sub-systems. On the other hand, muons
as quantum objects are still understood in a probabilistic and non-intuitive
manner, and it may take some additional effort to see if and how the dialectic
of Sense-Certainty, Perception, and so forth apply as they would to the chunk
of salt.

More importantly, while as a practical matter I take the muon as a claim to know,
a claim of a certain reality, as a physicist I am culturally acclimated to flee
from any metaphysical claim regarding my observation of the muon. Due to various
deficiencies in quantum theory, most notably the measurement problem of quantum
mechanics, and renormalization in field theory, it is customary to avoid any
metaphysical interpretations of quantum mechanical law. As a physicist, I test the
predictions of a theory, and announce the results. If the theory holds, it is
accepted that it may be relied upon in technical applications, that given some
sensory state of affairs now, one may expect with near certainty a predicted
sensory state of affairs later, nothing more. Any claim to truth or absolute
knowledge is rejected.

I must then ask myself, as a participant in the world, engaging in politics,
society, religion, and morality, if I have truly rejected any claim to
knowledge, or if I am merely leaving my inherent claims to knowledge
unexamined. Have I really limited myself to calculating various predictions
agnostic towards any worldview, or has my study of nature informed my
worldview in ways that I am not conscious of or understand?

My goal in reading the Phenomenology is then to attempt to understand Hegel's project
in its application to the objects of my own concern, in the realm of my work
as a physicist. Starting with my apprehension and understanding of quantum objects,
I will attempt to embrace rather than reject my inherent claims to know, and
work through the various shapes of consciousness taking for my object not
only the objects and principles of particle physics, but as the text guides me
also my own methodology, place within the community of physicists, and the
structure of the modern scientific worldview.
