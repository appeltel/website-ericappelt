           style="width: 50%; padding: 1em" alt="My Profile">
      <p>
        I am an enthusiast of mathematics, physics, and software
        development who has been lucky enough to professionally pursue
        all of these subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current focus is in software development. I'm presently
        employed at <a href="https://cloudant.com/">IBM Cloudant</a>
        where I primarily work on python applications that are deployed
        to manage several aspects of the cloud database service, such
        as metering, billing, account management, and platform integrations.
        I am also active in the Nashville Python community and a
        supporting member of the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">
        Python Software Foundation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I decided to follow my interests in computing full time,
        I was a research physicist employed at
        <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/">Vanderbilt University</a>
        pursuing research in heavy ion collisions in collaboration with the
        <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/">Compact Muon Solenoid</a> (CMS)
        experiment, where we studied a novel state of nuclear matter
        momentarily produced in the collisions of large nuclei.
        Working with the CMS collaboration was a fantastic opportunity
        to combine my interests in computer science, mathematical modeling,
        and the physics of quarks and gluons while traveling the world as
        part of an international scientific effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first professional job was teaching mathematics at
        <a href="http://www.usn.org/">University School of Nashville</a>.
        One of my key insights from this experience is well expressed in
        this Feynman anecdote from David Goodstein's book,
        <i>Feynman's Lost Lecture</i>:
        <br /><br />
        <i>
            Feynman was a truly great teacher. He prided himself on
            being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound
            ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him,
            "Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin
            one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics." Sizing up
            his audience perfectly, Feynman said, "I'll prepare a freshman
            lecture on it." But he came back a few days later to say,
            "I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman
            level. That means we don't really understand it."
        </i>
        <br /><br />
        My personal philosophy towards software engineering is drawn from
        this sort of attitude. If I cannot reasonably document or explain
        something, this indicates that my own comprehension is lacking.
        For this reason, I consider the practice of writing complete
        documentation, crafting tutorials, and giving talks to be essential
        to ensuring the soundness of any software that I implement.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Computing</h3>
      <p>
        Computing has always been a hobby of mine, starting in high school
        when I spent weekends configuring network services on desktop
        Linux systems while learning C and perl. As a
        professional physicist, I spent several years performing
        data analysis and stochastic simulations in C++ and python
        frameworks while also building monitoring tools for grid
        computing.
        </p>
        <p>
        Aside from my work responsibilities, I am currently volunteering
        to help with documentation and test coverage for the python
        reference implementation (CPython). The largest contribution I
        have made so far is documenting
        <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0525/">PEP-525</a> and
        <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0530/">PEP-530</a>
        (asynchronous generators and comprehensions) in the Python Language
        Reference. My focus at the moment is on
        <a href="https://github.com/asyncio-docs/">a project</a>
        to rewrite the asyncio documentation.
        I hope to eventually increase my understanding of the C
        implementation of python to make larger contributions to the
        language runtime itself.
        </p>
        <p>
        I decided to pursue software and computing full time based on
        the experience I had as a research scientist
        developing and maintaining data transfer and monitoring tools.
        These tools were used for the Vanderbilt Tier-2
        CMS computing facility which is a part of the
        <a href="http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/">Vanderbilt ACCRE facility</a>.
        One of the things I most enjoyed was writing a cluster monitoring
        system, originally as a set of bash scripts, and then as an
        informal python package. I called it
        <a href="https://github.com/appeltel/AutoCMS">AutoCMS</a>
        and as of this writing it is still in operation
        <a href="http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/autocms/autocms/skim_test/index.html">monitoring the cluster</a>.
        I used this package as a tool to transition to a professional
        developer, adding docstrings and automated unit tests.

        </p>
        <p>
        Over 1.5 Petabytes of collision data from the CMS experiment
        at the LHC are housed at the ACCRE facility using the
        <a href="http://www.lstore.org/">L-Store</a> logistical storage
        framework developed at Vanderbilt. Working closely with the
        operators and developers at the facility was a tremendous
        help in transitioning from physics to software as it gave
        me several years of experience working in a large scale
        computing facility.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Physics</h3>
        <p>
        From 2009 to 2015, I worked in collaboration with the
        <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/">Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)</a>
        experiment at the world's most powerful particle accelerator, the
        <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider">
          Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</a>, to study the properties of
        nuclear matter at extreme temperatures of over a trillion degrees
        Kelvin. The CMS experiment is a $500 million international
        detector system with excellent capabilities to precisely determine the
        momentum of charged particles created in collisions between
        protons or heavy nuclei.

        </p>
        <p>
        By colliding two heavy nuclei at close to the speed of light,
        a high temperature bulk system can be created for a very short
        span of time, in which the protons and neutrons that comprise the
        nuclei are predicted to undergo a phase transition into a new
        state of nuclear matter often called a Quark-Gluon Plasma.
        </p>
        <p>
        My recent work has focused on the measurement of charged particles
        produced in collisions between a single proton and a heavy nucleus,
        which helps to enhance the understanding of the various effects that
        modify charged particle production in nucleus-nucleus collisions
        relative to proton-proton collisions.
