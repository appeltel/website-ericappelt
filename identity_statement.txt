Hash: SHA256

In the wake of the Equifax breach, I have decided to start using PGP to
produce signed messages to authenticate my identity and to produce signed
messages to verify any non-routine financial or other transaction of
any importance. While I doubt that this will have any practical relevance,
I intend to do this to at minimum raise awareness of the extremely poor
state of online authentication. Currently most financial and commercial
organizations are perfectly willing to "authenticate" an individual based
upon their ability to recite their Social Security Number, date of birth,
and other trivial information that should be presumed to be in the hands
of criminals.

In order to verify that I (Eric Andrew Appelt) am the person who has written
this document, please find me in person and I will give you a card with the
fingerprint of the PGP key used to sign this document.

I believe that authentication should work this way - or in some similar
fashion that uses asymmetric key encryption. I should be able to go to a
bank, car dealership, or place of work, and present government issued photo
ID along with a digital fingerprint corresponding to a private key known only
to me. The bank would then have linked my identity to the key and can trust
that messages signed with that key are authentic, unless I revoke that key.
We, as a society, could even rely on the government or private instutions to
provide such trusted links between actual individuals and the digital
keys they have published to use to authenticate themselves. In principle,
it should be possible to write software that makes this managable and even
simple for the average consumer.

I further believe that we accept the status quo purely based on the normative
power of the actual. If using social security numbers was not already an
accepted method of authenticating an individual over the phone, all security
and industry experts would consider it to be criminally negligent to
do so. It only seems "weird" to present digital fingerprints for private
keys because it is rarely done. It should be normal. People should be
extremely alarmed about the status quo. Your identity is insecure, and there
is little you can do to protect it because we have no sensible system
put in place as a society to authenticate your communications.
