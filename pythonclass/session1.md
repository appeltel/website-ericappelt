# Language Basics

### Suggested Readings:

* Automate Stuff: Chapters 0\*, 1\*, and 2\*
* Learning Python: Chapters 4\*, 5\*, 6\*, 7\* (especially 6)

### Suggested Exercises:

* Write a program to take an integer that the user inputs and print
  the corresponding
  [Fibonacci Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
  The Fibonacci sequence begins 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, so if the user
  inputs 7, the user should see the 7th Fibonacci number printed,
  which is 13. If the user inputs a negative number the program should
  print an error message.
* Write a program to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius or
  vice versa. Have the user select which one from a menu
  (use a triple-quoted string to make the menu text) or quit from the
  program. Use a while loop to allow the user to convert multiple values.
