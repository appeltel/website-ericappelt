# Modules, Dates, OS Functions, and Virtual Environments

### Suggested Readings

* Automate Stuff: Chapter 11
* Learning Python: Chapters 22\*, 23\*

### Suggested Exercises

* Write a module with a public function that takes a directory path as
  an argument and returns a dictionary all (regular) file names and
  their associated size in bytes
  * Hint: Use `os.listdir` for directory contents, `os.is_file` to
    filter non-regular files, and `os.stat` to get sizes.
  * Allow the module to be run as a script, in which case it should
    (nicely) print the sizes for all files in the current directory.
    If the module is imported it should not do this.
* Add another function similar to the first but that returns a dictionary
  of the file names and the number of days since each file was modified
  * Hint: Use `datetime.fromtimestamp(...)` and the `st_mtime` attribute
    of the `os.stat(...)` result to manipulate the modification time as
    a datetime object.
