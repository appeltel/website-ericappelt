* Learning Python: Chapters 8\*, 9\*

### Suggested Exercises

* Do the "Character Picture Grid" project in Automate Stuff Chapter 4.
  Note that `print("Hello World!", end="")` will print the string `Hello World!`
  without a newline.
* Do the "Comma Code" project in Automate Stuff Chapter 4, but don't worry about
  writing a function as we haven't gone over it yet.
  Just write code to handle the example string.
