# Strings, Bytes, and Files

### Suggested Readings:

* Automate Stuff: Chapters 5, 6\*, 7
* Learning Python: Chapters 10, 11, 12

### Suggested Exercises:

* Save the csv content below into a file. This information is the
  last name, first name, and age of employees of an imaginary company,
  animals.com. Write a script to read in the csv file and then write a
  new file with all the information as well as a fourth column with the
  email address of each employee. The email address of an employee is
  comprised of their last name (up to the first seven letters, all
  lowercase) followed by the first letter of their first name (lowercase)
  at animals.com. For example, I am Eric Appelt and my email would
  be `appelte@animals.com`. Ada Lovelace would be `lovelaca@animals.com`.

* Do the table printer project in chapter 6 of automate the boring stuff
  (it doesn't need to be a function, just a script to process the example
  list).
