# A Foundation in Python for Researchers and Scientists 

This course is a foundation in python programming geared primarily
towards scientific researchers, data scientists, and more generally
anyone seeking a more solid foundation in the core python language
and some of the avaialable tools. The course is primarily designed
for people who have some programming experience, although experience
with python is not required.

The content and focus of the course is based on my experience as
a scientist who for many years used python clumsily without a deeper
understanding of the language. It is intended to be the course that
I wish I had taken earlier on while first trying to use the language
productively.

My hope is that by completing this course one will have developed
sufficient proficiency with the language to write maintainable,
reusable, and testable code that is suitable for sharing with
colleagues. While the later part of the course will introduce some of
the basic scientific libaries and tools such as
[numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
and [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/),
the main focus of the course is building a solid foundation in the
core language itself. I believe that once one has such a foundation,
an enterprising researcher will be well positioned to further
learn libraries and tools on their own.
