# A Foundation in Python for Researchers and Scientists 

This course is a foundation in python programming geared primarily
towards scientific researchers, data scientists, and more generally
anyone seeking a more solid foundation in the core python language
and some of the avaialable tools. The course is primarily designed
for people who have some programming experience, although experience
with python is not required.

The content and focus of the course is based on my experience as
a scientist who for many years used python clumsily without a deeper
understanding of the language. It is intended to be the course that
I wish I had taken earlier on while first trying to use the language
productively.

My hope is that by completing this course one will have developed
sufficient proficiency with the language to write maintainable,
reusable, and testable code that is suitable for sharing with
colleagues. While the later part of the course will introduce some of
the basic scientific libaries and tools such as
[numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
and [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/),
the main focus of the course is building a solid foundation in the
core language itself. I believe that once one has such a foundation,
an enterprising researcher will be well positioned to further
learn libraries and tools on their own.

## Course Format

The course will consist of 75 minute interactive sessions. In these,
I will present concepts and interactively explore them on the python
interpreter while course attendees follow along on their own laptops,
allowing each student to try variations on their own. It is my hope
and expectation that this exploration is frequently interrupted by
questions about the examples which we will further investigate. I will
leave ample room in the material to accommodate such investigation.

I will assign exercises to be worked on between course sessions, and
optional readings from two selected textbooks. There will be no formal
evaluations, but I hope that students will find the exercises useful and
I will make myself available to help with the exercises.
