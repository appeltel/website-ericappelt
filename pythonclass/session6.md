# Exceptions, Logging, and Context Managers

### Suggested Readings

* Automate Stuff: Chapter 10\*
* Learning Python: Chapters 19, 20, 21

### Suggested Exercises

* Write a command line utility in python that counts the number of lines
  in a file and prints them. to standard output.
  * The utility should take the name of a file as an argument. To do
    this use `import sys` and then `sys.argv[1]` will be the first
    argument given.
  * By trial and error, determine the type of exception raised when the
    user fails to run the program with an argument, the file specified does
    not exist, or the user does not have permission to read the file specified.
  * using try/except blocks, handle each of these exception types separately
    and send an appropriate message to the user in each case.
