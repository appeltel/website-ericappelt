# Iteration Protocol, Generators, Sequences

### Suggested Readings

* Automate Stuff: Chapter 15
* Learning Python: Chapters 33, 34

### Suggested Exercises

* Write a generator function that returns the next X Tuesdays as `datetime.datetime`
  objects for midnight on that Tuesday.
  * Use this to find out how many Tuesdays there are in 2025.
* Make a similar "infinite generator" that endlessly returns Tuesdays.
  * Use this infinite generator to determine the date of the last Tuesday in 2056
* Write a generator expression that returns the square root of the first 10M even
  integers.
  * Use this in a for loop with `enumerate` to find the integer for which the sum of
    all previous square roots is at least 10000
  * Try this again using a list comprehension rather than a generator expression
    and note the difference in performance. Explain why the generator expression version
    is so much faster.

### Preliminary Session Notes

These are scanned, handwritten notes to be replaced with typed notes:

* [Preliminary Session Notes](Python_lesson_11.pdf)

I will keep these available until the typed and updated notes are complete.
