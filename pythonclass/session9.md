# Classes Part I

### Suggested Readings

* Automate Stuff: Chapter 13
* Learning Python: Chapters 26\*, 27\*, 28\*

### Suggested Exercises

* Add some functionality to our `DiceSet` class:
  * Implement the `count_attempts` method that we skipped in class
  * Implement maximum and minimum methods that return the max
     and min possible roll from the set
  * Implement a range method that returns a list of all
    possible values rolled by the set. Use this to improve
    `count_attempts` to raise an exception immediately if the
    value is impossible
* Write unit tests for the DiceSet class using pytest.
